# Background
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlight two critical global issues: the persistent gender inequalities and the increasing threats posed by climate change. While these issues are often examined independently, they intersect in many ways. Climate change exacerbates gender disparities, particularly in marginalized communities, where women, girls, and gender minorities face heightened vulnerability during environmental crises.

For example, natural disasters disproportionately impact womenâ€™s livelihoods, education, health, and personal safety. Women in rural and agricultural communities often bear the brunt of climate change-induced disruptions, such as droughts and floods, that intensify poverty and reduce access to resources.
Addressing this issue is a key focus of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Understanding how climate change affects gender inequalities and vice versa is critical to formulating policies that promote resilience and gender equity in climate adaptation strategies.

This project proposes a data-driven approach using a combination of Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Traditional Machine Learning techniques. This hybrid approach will allow us to model the relationship between climate change and gender inequality by leveraging structured and unstructured data sources, including reports, publications, and climate datasets.

# Objectives
- Policy Effectiveness: Evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at mitigating climate change and promoting gender equality.

- Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Development: Based on the trends of the features, infrastructure improvements (e.g., flood-resistant housing, drought-resistant agriculture) could focus on reducing the disproportionate burden by improving access to critical resources.

- Resource Allocation and Disaster Relief: Understanding the local climate dynamics (temperature, precipitation, wind) helps allocate resources to vulnerable populations, with specific attention to the needs of marginalized communities (e.g. distribution of aid post-disaster).

- Risk Assessment and Early Warning Systems: These climate features can be used to develop predictive models that highlight areas at higher risk for disasters such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves. Policy measures can be directed to these regions to ensure disaster preparedness plans.

# Methodology
- Data Collection
    - Gender Inequality Data: Data on gender gaps in education, health, employment, and political participation etc will be collected from various sources. 
- Climate Change Data: Climate data from sources such as https://power.larc.nasa.gov   
- Policy Documents, Reports, Journals: Relevant reports, research papers and documents that highlight the gendered impacts of climate change.
